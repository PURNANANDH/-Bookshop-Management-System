# BookshopManagementSystem
Develop a C++ Bookshop Management System using inheritance and polymorphism. The system allows adding textbooks and novels, searching by title or ISBN, and displaying books. Textbooks have a subject and novels have a genre. The program provides a menu-based interface with options to add, search, display, and exit.

The system should allow the user to perform various operations such as adding textbooks and novels to the bookshop, searching for books by title or ISBN, and displaying all the books in the bookshop.

The system should utilize inheritance and polymorphism concepts to model different types of books. There are two types of books: textbooks and novels. Both types of books share common attributes such as title, author, ISBN, price, and quantity. However, textbooks also have an additional attribute called subject, while novels have a genre.

The program should provide a menu-based interface where the user can select different options. The menu should include the following options:

FEATURES:

=>Add Textbook: This option allows the user to add a new textbook to the bookshop. The user should be prompted to enter the title, author, ISBN, price, quantity, and subject of the textbook.

=>Add Novel: This option allows the user to add a new novel to the bookshop. The user should be prompted to enter the title, author, ISBN, price, quantity, and genre of the novel.

=>Search Book : This option enables the user to search for a book in the bookshop by its title or ISBN or gerne or subject. The program should display all the books whose title or subject matches the search term entered by the user.

=>Display Books: This option displays all the books currently available in the bookshop, along with their respective details such as title, author, ISBN, price, and quantity.

=>Exit: This option terminates the program.
