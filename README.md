# -Bookshop-Management-System
Develop a C++ Bookshop Management System using inheritance and polymorphism. The system allows adding textbooks and novels, searching by title or ISBN, and displaying books. Textbooks have a subject and novels have a genre. The program provides a menu-based interface with options to add, search, display, and exit.
